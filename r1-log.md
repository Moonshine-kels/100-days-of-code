## Log

### R1D1 
Finally completed the "Applied Visial Design" on FreeCodeCamp.com. I am on my way to getting the responsive Web Design certificate!! :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: I also finished completed a section on Open App Academy called "nested loops and 2d arrays". Omg was that difficult to do. 
Thoughts: Not gonna lie. Coding is not easy but my enjoyment overpasses the frustrations. :muscle: :sunglasses: :brain: Oh and this is time consuming doing 2+ hours of coding each day. I got this!!

### R1D2
I completed 1 hour of applied accessibility but didn't complete it all. I did half of my goal. 

Thoughts: I got distracted and didn't feel satisfied with my results will do better the next day.

### R1D3
 I have compeleted applied accessibility section for the Responsive Web Design Certificate.
