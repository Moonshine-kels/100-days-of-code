## Log

### R1D1 
Finally completed the "Applied Visial Design" on FreeCodeCamp.com. I am on my way to getting the responsive Web Design certificate!! :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: I also finished completed a section on Open App Academy called "nested loops and 2d arrays". Omg was that difficult to do. 
Thoughts: Not gonna lie. Coding is not easy but my enjoyment overpasses the frustrations. :muscle: :sunglasses: :brain: Oh and this is time consuming doing 2+ hours of coding each day. I got this!!

### R1D2
I completed 1 hour of applied accessibility but didn't complete it all. I did half of my goal. 

Thoughts: I got distracted and didn't feel satisfied with my results will do better the next day.

### R1D3
 I have compeleted applied accessibility section for the Responsive Web Design Certificate. 
 
I am trying to do the exercises of Hashes on Open App Academy and man it is super difficult to complete. I can never seem to figure it out myself and always look at the hints and solutions. Idk if it is just me that I do not understand it and give up too easily or if I need a tutuor to help me lol. Nevertheless, I am not going to give up. I'm going to try harder than last time and will try to figure it out even if it rips my brains out. I'll go back to my notes look at the previous exercises and do them!! 

### R1D4
I have started a guide that I found on githud that will help with learning how to code. I'm remembering how to do algebra because it has been forever but I still got it lol. I have passed the quizes with a breeze on khan academy. 

Also, I am learning Java on khan and created some cute little designs. One is called menacing bully and the other blushing paper boy. I loved it because it just sparks up my creativity, and I am a very creative person. 

I have stopped, the web development because I want to get through this guide. Once I am halfway done I'll go back to it. 

Also, with App Academy, I have put it on hold till I am done with khan's courses of programming. 

I love this and I am excited to do more tomorrow!
